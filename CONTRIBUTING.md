# Contributor Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**  
   Fork the project to make your changes without affecting the original codebase.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/himeshparashar/Social-Morph.git

3. **Create a new branch**  
   It's a good idea to work in a branch separate from  `master`. Name your branch according to the feature or issue you're working on.

   ```

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

5. **Push your changes to your forked repository**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

6. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   Once you're satisfied with your changes, open a Pull Request from your feature branch to the `master` branch of this repository. Provide a clear description of what you have done and why.
